Hi {{ student.first_name }},<br><br>

How's it going? I hope first term is treating you well!<br><br>

I'd like to invite you to review your room on the Room Balloting System by visiting the link below. Information you
    give in your review will also help us price rooms more fairly.<br><br>

<a href="https://ballot.downingjcr.co.uk">Review my Room!</a><br><br>

If the information on the system is incorrect, for example because you have changed your room selection since
    ballot weekend, just drop me an email and I'll do my best to get it sorted :)<br><br>

Downing love,<br><br>
